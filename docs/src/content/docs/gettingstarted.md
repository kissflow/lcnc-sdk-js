Kissflow provides a robust set of SDK methods to help you build efficient low-code apps with ease. This document outlines the various SDK methods available for use in forms, apps, and integrations using JavaScript. These methods allow you to retrieve information about variables and components within your app, enabling seamless customization and enhanced functionality.

In addition to method details, this document provides step-by-step instructions on installing packages to create two types of custom components: Page and field component.

Kissflow empowers you to design and import custom UI components using plain HTML or frontend frameworks like React, making them reusable within your app.

To enable interaction between your custom components and your Kissflow app, you can install the Kissflow SDK in your project. [Learn more](/components/page/) about installing the package and building components.
