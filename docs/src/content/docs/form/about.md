A form is an entity that you can use to collect input from the people who participate in your workflows. Forms are predominantly used in flows like processes, boards, and dataforms in Kissflow. A form has three primary components - section, field, and table. 

SDKs for forms are available in both apps and in the individual flows in the Kissflow. The available methods are:
1. getField()
2. updateField()
3. getTable()
4. toJSON()

>Note: Formâ€™s SDKs exclusively support read and update methods, with no provision for create and delete operations.
