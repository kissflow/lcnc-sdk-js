The `kf.context` method lets you access specific method based on the entity
where you're using it.

Context methods are polymorphic, it has different classes pre-initialized based
on execution context.

For example, if you're calling `kf.context` inside, you'll be able to access
methods such as `getFields`, `updateFields`, `getTable`, etc.

Below are the places where you can use `kf.context`

### Custom components

When `kf.context` is used inside a custom component code, `watchParams` method
can be used to subscribe for the changes happen through mapped params
