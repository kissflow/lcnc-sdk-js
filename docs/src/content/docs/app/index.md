There are several SDK methods that you can use to retrieve information from and about the app that is currently in use. Below are a few examples:

To get information about the current active instance of a Kissflow app, use `kf.app`.
To retrieve the appâ€™s ID, use `kf.app._id.`

The command `kf.app` and its associated methods are accessible in the following:

- Forms within the app.
- Custom components.
- Across all widgets and popup events inside a page and other page events.
- Bulk and custom actions in dataforms inside the app.
